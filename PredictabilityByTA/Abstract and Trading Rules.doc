Abstract

  Assets with "hard-to-value" fundamentals, such as Bitcoin and stocks in new industries --> difficult to predict returns 
  An equilibrium model shows how rational learning enables return predictability through technical analysis. 
  Ratios of prices to their moving averages forecast daily Bitcoin returns. 
  Trading strategies based on these ratios generate significant alpha and Sharpe ratio gains relative to a buy-and-hold position. 
  Similar results hold for small-cap, young-firm, and low-analyst-coverage stocks as well as NASDAQ stocks during the dotcom era.

Trading rules

  -- Target asset for investment: Exclusively Bitcoin.
  -- Obtain daily Bitcoin price data from: Coindesk.com.
  -- Determine the 10-day moving average on day t: Average of the prices from the last 10 days (not counting day t).
  -- Purchase indicator: Buy Bitcoin when the ratio of (price on day t-1) to (10-day moving average) exceeds 1.
  -- Sale indicator: Liquidate Bitcoin and move to a risk-free asset when the ratio of (price on day t-1) to (10-day moving average) is less than 1.
  -- Adjust positions daily.
  -- Only trade actively with 10% of the total portfolio.
